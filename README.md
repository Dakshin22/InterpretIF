# InterpretIF

Interactive fiction is a type of story where the user determines certain actions that happen, and in turn affect how the story plays out.

This project takes in a HTML file that includes all of the potential paths of a specific story and tokenizes the different parts of the story, so it is able to display the required passages according to user decisions.
